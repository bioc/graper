R package for a variational Bayes approach to adaptive regularization of feature groups as used in 'Adaptive regularization in high-dimensional regression and classification with external covariates using variational Bayes'. The main function is fit_grpRR, which fits the variational Bayes model given data X, a response y and a group annotation annot.
